# Bannon Lawn Care website

Self-sourced web development contract where I developed and deployed a website for a local business. In doing so, I was able to analyze
business interests, translate technical concepts to a non-technical audience, as well as work in an HTML/CSS environment.

A demonstration of the website can be found [here](https://pauljflanagan.github.io/BannonLawnCare/ "Bannon Lawn Care Website").
